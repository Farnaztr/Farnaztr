## 🧠 About Me

I'm a junior developer who enjoys bringing ideas to life with code.  
I love figuring out how things work — and breaking them on purpose to learn faster.  
Currently exploring web fundamentals and sharpening my logic skills across different languages.

- Python 🐍  
- HTML / CSS 🌐  
- C# 💠  
- JavaScript (just diving in!) ✨

- DOM manipulation with JavaScript  
- OOP principles in C#  
- CSS Flexbox & responsive layouts

## 📁 Projects

I like to keep things simple, useful, and mine.  
You can find some fun CLI tools, HTML playgrounds, and tools like [IPScout](https://github.com/farnaztr/IPScout) here.

## 🐾 A Thought
